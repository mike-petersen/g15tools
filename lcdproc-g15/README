This is a patch against lcdproc CVS HEAD.  Apply the patch and add g15*.{c,h} to
<lcdproc root>/server/drivers.  Configure with --enable-drivers=g15.  This
driver requires g15daemon-1.2 and libg15render.  This driver is nearly feature
complete, and will soon be submitted for inclusion in lcdproc.

The Keymap is as follows:

Escape = G1
Enter  = L1
Left   = L2
Up     = L3
Down   = L4
Right  = L5
